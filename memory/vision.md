# Vision

Build a personal, reliable rotation + TD-driven signal stack for 4h/1h that:
- Maximizes clarity: clear reasons, invalidation (TDST), and risk:reward.
- Prioritizes liquid majors/large alts; avoid illiquid tails.
- Operates locally with reproducible backtests and minimal ops.

## Constraints
- Capital: personal; risk per trade ≈ 0.75% of equity.
- Instruments: Spot (Binance) and Perps (Hyperliquid) with conservative leverage.
- Cadence: 4h HTF, 1h LTF; refresh every 10–15m.
